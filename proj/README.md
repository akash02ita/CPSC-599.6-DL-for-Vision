# Project: OCR text detection

The project is to design a model pipeline to extract text from medical images by (1) first classifying type of embedded text, printed or handwritten, (2) extract the text from image with the specific model, (3) re-fill the image to remove text embeddings and resemble as closely as possible to the original image.

Currently, the 1st phase of the pipeline has been implemented, with more work coming along in future.
