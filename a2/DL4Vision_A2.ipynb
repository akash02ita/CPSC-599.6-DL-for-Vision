The image of a digit in the MNIST dataset has a black background (0 value for pixel values). This might be like writing with white chalk on a blackboard. We make slight changes in the test datasets by applying a simple change `image = 1 - image`. In other words, we invert the pixel intensity values. The resulting images resemble a digit written with a black marker on a whiteboard. Test the model using the updated test_dataset, and report your observations regarding model performance. How would you change your pipeline if you redo this experiment? (15 points)"
